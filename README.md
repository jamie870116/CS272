In the realm of software development, ensuring the robustness and reliability of code through unit testing is crucial. However, traditional manual approaches to generating unit tests are time-consuming and labor-intensive. Recent advancements have leveraged deep learning to automate this process, yet these tools face chal- lenges such as generating difficult-to-understand test cases, lacking interaction with code execution engines, and being restricted to specific programming languages or scenarios. Addressing these limitations, we introduce AgentUTest, an inno- vative agent-driven automated testing tool designed to enhance testing efficiency across various programming languages and paradigms. AgentUTest utilizes a novel Generate-Discuss-Verify loop mechanism, employing multi-agent systems based on leading Large Language Models to generate, review, and verify unit test cases. Additionally, AgentUTest includes a dynamic visualization interactive interface, offering an intuitive user experience for developers to effectively engage in the testing process.
